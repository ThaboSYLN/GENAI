📌 Generative AI Prompting with Google Gemini

🚀 Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to use Google's Generative AI models, specifically gemini-2.0-flash, to generate text-based content using API calls.

✨ Features

✅ Uses Google GenAI (google-genai library) for text generation.✅ Implements retry logic to handle API rate limits and service availability issues.✅ Retrieves the API key from Google Colab's userdata storage.✅ Generates AI-based responses to prompts related to AI concepts and advice for computer science students.

📥 Installation
